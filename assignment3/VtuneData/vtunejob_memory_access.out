    Memory Bound: 34.7% of Pipeline Slots
     | The metric value is high. This may indicate that a significant fraction
     | of execution pipeline slots could be stalled due to demand memory load
     | and stores. Explore the metric breakdown by memory hierarchy, memory
     | bandwidth information, and correlation by memory objects.
     |
        L1 Bound: 7.0% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled without missing the
         | L1 data cache. The L1 cache typically has the shortest latency.
         | However, in certain cases like loads blocked on older stores, a load
         | might suffer a high latency even though it is being satisfied by the
         | L1.
         |
        L2 Bound: 8.4% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often machine was stalled on L2 cache. Avoiding
         | cache misses (L1 misses/L2 hits) will improve the latency and
         | increase performance.
         |
        L3 Bound: 0.0% of Clockticks
        DRAM Bound: 18.3% of Clockticks
         | This metric shows how often CPU was stalled on the main memory
         | (DRAM). Caching typically improves the latency and increases
         | performance.
